Given a string and a positive number k, find the longest substring of the string containing k distinct characters.
If k is more than the total number of distinct characters in the string, return the whole string.

For example, consider string abcbdbdbbdcdabd.

For k = 2, o/p is ‘bdbdbbd’
For k = 3, o/p is ‘bcbdbdbbdcd’
For k = 5, o/p is ‘abcbdbdbbdcdabd’
