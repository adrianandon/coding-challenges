Write a function that takes a string and compresses it. That is, for every repeating 
character at a given position in the input string, add the character and it's count number 
in the output string. 
 

Example:

Input: "aaaabbbcddaxaa"	
Output: "a4b3cd2axa2"

Wrap the function in a thread-safe singleton class because why not?
